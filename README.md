# BRAIN_TUMOR

🧠 Advanced Brain Tumor Analysis with GAN-Enhanced Imaging
Early diagnosis of brain tumors is critical for effective treatment. This project introduces a robust AI-powered imaging pipeline that leverages synthetic data generation and deep learning models to automate brain tumor detection, classification, and localization.

🔍 Overview
This solution integrates Progressive GANs (PGGAN) for synthetic MRI data generation and a fine-tuned VGG19 architecture for accurate tumor classification. Packaged as a responsive web application, it bridges complex medical AI with usability and clinical relevance.

🛠️ Core Functionalities
Automated Tumor Detection
Upload MRI images and receive instant analysis on the presence of abnormal tissue.

Tumor Type Classification
The model identifies the tumor category from a multi-class dataset.

Visual Localization
Detected tumors are highlighted directly on the MRI image for visual interpretation.

🔄 Processing Pipeline
1. Image Preparation
Standardized preprocessing ensures consistent data input for model accuracy:

Image resizing and alignment

Intensity normalization

Region-focused cropping

Skull-stripping and Gaussian-based denoising

2. Synthetic MRI Generation (PGGAN)
A PGGAN-based generator enriches the dataset by synthesizing realistic, high-resolution brain scans—crucial for overcoming dataset limitations.

3. Data Augmentation
Further variability is introduced via:

Rotations and flips

Shearing and shifting

Mirroring and zooming

4. Deep Learning Model: VGG19
A modified VGG19 architecture, enhanced via transfer learning, performs the tumor classification:

Activation Functions: ReLU (hidden layers), Softmax (output layer)

Batch Normalization: Boosts convergence and model performance

5. Evaluation Metrics
The model is validated across industry-standard metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Cohen’s Kappa, AUC

Confusion Matrix
